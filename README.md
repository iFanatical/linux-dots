# linux-dots

This is a repository of custom configuration files that have been created or found by Fanatical.

Credit to the following authors:
DistroTube - .bashrc inspiration, various configuration files that have been heavily modified, and just general Linux knowledge

Chris Titus Tech - starship.toml is CTT's, also modified to my liking - an excellent resource for learning how to break your system, and repair it :)

The Nordic theme in this repo is from the AUR, labeled "Nordic"

Rofi launchers not made by me! Find them here: https://github.com/adi1090x/rofi?tab=readme-ov-file
