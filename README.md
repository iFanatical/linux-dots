This is a repository of custom configuration files that have been created or found by Fanatical.

Credit to the following authors:
DistroTube - .bashrc inspiration, various configuration files that have been heavily modified, and just general Linux knowledge
Chris Titus Tech - starship.toml is CTT's, also modified to my liking

The Nordic theme in this repo is from the AUR, labeled "Nordic"
